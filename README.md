In this study, we examine China's pursuit of ambitious climate goals within the context of its energy
consumption, economic growth, and other various sectors. Employing a diverse range of forecasting
methodologies such as ARIMA, LSTM and Prophet against a hybrid model with the average of the 3
aforementioned forecasting models, we assess the nation's progress towards reducing carbon
emissions. The analysis revealed that, barring one exception, China is well on track to achieving its
climate targets for most sectors. However, an intriguing discussion emerges around the effectiveness
and ambiguity of China's goals, particularly through the use of GDP as a metric to account for a
nationâ€™s growth, as a means to make a significant global impact on climate change. The study
highlights the need for more comprehensive indicators that encompass a broader array of
socioeconomic and environmental factors. Moreover, the hybrid forecasting approach showcased
promising outcomes for sectors without significant exogenous predictors, but also underscored the
complexities involved in incorporating external factors into forecasting models for other sectors. As
China navigates its climate journey, the research emphasizes the importance of evolving forecasting
methodologies to align with sector-specific dynamics, paving the way for a more sustainable and
impactful reduction in carbon emissions.
